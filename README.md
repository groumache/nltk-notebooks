# nltk-notebooks

I started playing around with natural language processing with the nltk book. I also played a bit with **Stanford Open Information Extraction** (OpenIE).

Here is the command I used:
```java -mx1g -cp "*" edu.stanford.nlp.naturalli.OpenIE```


* I am ten years old -> (I, am old, ten years)
* Stanford is a big university -> (Stanford, is, university), (Stanford, is, big), (Stanford, is, big university)
* My father and my mother love each other -> *No extraction*
